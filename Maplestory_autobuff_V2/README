[MUST RUN SCRIPT WITH ADMIN PRIVILEGES]
Running the script without admin privileges will not allow key-simulations to work.

Keyboard (Simulate input)

Path for assets:
C:/Python/

V2 Features:

This script uses PyAutogui's 'LocateOnScreen' module to identify the image of the buff to determine whether or not to cast the buff.
Buff is casted by simulating the bound key using the Keyboard module. (This may interrupt other key presses)

Upon selecting a class; press 'confirm'. 
[optional] Rebind keys by typing out the chosen key i.e. "F5" must be typed out manually. More information can be found here: https://github.com/boppreh/keyboard
